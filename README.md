# GeoGuessr

GeoGuessr is a Python AI project that attempts to guess the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location based solely on a streetview image. The project includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implemented using Tkinter, which displays the guessed location on a map and indicates its proximity to the actual location.

Training Images were collected using Webscrapers (from Flickr) and Google's StreetView API. 

## Features

- AI-powered location guessing from streetview images
- Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction
- Map visualization showcasing the guessed location and its accuracy
